# Beyond Ping
A top-down delayed space exploration game

## HUD 
Distance, connection (good, bad)
direction of goal
radar with objects
input queue

## Mechanics
map
 - color coding of connection quality
 - show taken path ("chem trail")
Start from the commander space station/planet
steering:
 - either apply thrust with analog stick
 - direction with analog stick + thrust with trigger
 - how to slow/fast? hold to increase force is bad imo because you cant steer during charge time
gravity of obstacles
obstacles:
 - static planets
 - moving asteroids / debris
death on single collision
objective:
 - navigate to goal (collect, save astronaut)

## Starting Issue:
100 -> 0% connectivity
100% .. 0ms
0% .. 2000ms

## Nice to have:
gas or O2 decreases and has to be refilled at commander
lighting with sun(s) and headlights
